# Week 5: Open data and APIs

## Agenda
*   This class will be recorded (remind me if I forget!)
*   Back to in-person! Remote for some. Logistics?
*   Log in to the class JupyterHub using the [UP206A Git Puller](https://jupyter.idre.ucla.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fyohman%2F22W-UP206A&urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2F22W-UP206A%2F&branch=master) to avoid the bottleneck
- Concerns?
- Lab: Part 1- code review with open data
- Break
- Lab: Part 2- Mapping arrests

## Assignments
- [Midterms](../../Midterm%20and%20Finals)
- Presentations
  -  7 minutes for "solo" projects, 8 minutes for two person groups
  -  Each group member must present a portion of the project, for roughly an equal time of the presentation
  -  You can use any form of visual aids, including powerpoints, google slides, spreadsheets, and/or JupyterNotebooks
  -  Prepare and rehearse
  -  Most importantly, tell a story, and convey why this is an important issue that warrants our attention

Tips for a good presentation:
- Images are worth 1000 words (i.e. minimal use of bullet points)
- Let your visuals narrate the story you tell, not text or bullet points
- Talk to the audience, not your computer or the screen
- Show your passion!
